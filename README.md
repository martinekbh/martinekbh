### Hi there 👋

I am a PhD student at the University of Oslo (UiO), and hold a master's degree in Computer Science.
My interests are within machine learning/deep learning, mathematical optimization, and complexity theory.

My repositories are for projects and assignments I have done for various courses I have taken at UiO.

I mostly use Pytorch and Python, but I have also done projects in Tensorflow, MATLAB, and R.
Other languages include Java and C.
